# Introduction

*How Am I going to die* ? We all one day ask ourselves this question. And, of course, this question is often followed by *When Am I going to die ?*. The way we are going to die. Although these questions cannot be answered, it is important to identify the number of deaths and their causes to have a better understanding of the situation in a country.

> > > An important input to national and international health decision-making and planning processes is a consistent and comparative analysis of the causes of death across different population groups (Mathers, C.B., Boerma T., Ma Fat D. (2009))

Indeed, the causes of death differ from one country to another, and also from one person to another. It depends on many factors, i.e., the social-economic environment, the age, the family, etc. It is important for a family to know which disease occurs whithin the family, and it is important for the country to know which are the causes of deaths of the population. To know that, there are a lot of database that exist for many countries. The one from which we extracted the data needed for our essay comes from the [World Health Organization](@https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-leading-causes-of-death).

## Research question

In this essay, we will be interested in the differences between the three leading causes of death across ages, and more precisely between children and adults. We will less focused on the number of death in itself, since it is not surprising that more people died when they get older, but rather on the type of causes, whether it is communicable, meaning that it is transmitted to one another (genetic illnesses), non-communicable and injuries, meaning the causes that comes from the external world (car accident), or from ourselves. Our data set will concern only Switzerland's population in 2019. The difference between this country and the others could be the subject of another scientific report.

Our research question is the following : **Is there a difference in the type of deaths between children and adults ?**

## Hypothesis

-   H0 : there is no differences in the type of deaths between children and adults in Switzerland in 2019

-   H1 : There is a differences in the type of deaths between children and adults in Switzerland in 2019

## Prediction

Young adults and adults died mostly from injuries, compared to children and seniors, who died mostly from non-communicable and communicable diseases.

## Dataset

The dataset for this scientific report comes from

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
Deathstat <- read_excel("~/UNINE/UniNE/Master en Sciences cognitives/Data science/Data - Scientific report/Final Scientific report/Deathstat.xlsx")
```

Here is a view of the variables used in this scientific report.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str(Deathstat)
```

# The three main causes of deaths in Switzerland in 2019

What are the three main causes of deaths in Switzerland in 2019 across all ages (0-85+) ?

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
DeathAll <-Deathstat[1:3,]

ggplot(DeathAll, aes(x=fct_reorder(Cause, Nb), y=Nb, fill=Category,width = 0.5)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Causes of death") + 
  ylab("Number of death per 100'000 people (0-85+)") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Lightblue"))
```

In this graph, we can see that the three most common deaths for all groups are ischaemic heart disease (cause n°1), Alzheimer disease and other dementia (cause n°2), and stroke (cause n°3). All of these causes are considered "non-communicable".

What is this telling us ? First of all, let's take a look at the number of death per 100'000 people between ages :

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
DeathADCH <- Deathstat[4:60,]

ggplot(DeathADCH, aes(x=fct_relevel(Age, c("5-9"), after = 2), y=Nb)) +
  geom_point(color="Lightpink", size=4, alpha=0.6) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=Age, xend=Age, y=0, yend=Nb)) +
  theme_light() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Age groups") +
  ylab("Number of death per 100'000 people (0-85+)") +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

What we can see is that the number of death per 100'000 people is quite high for children between 0 and 1 years-old, compared to people between 1 and 49 years-old. Then, the number increase from 50 years-old and reach the highest for the 85 years-old and more.

That explains why the three main causes of death across all ages in Switzerland in 2019 is composed only of non-communicable diseases.

### Statistical tests

```{r}
TestLM <- lm(Nb~Age, data = Deathstat)
summary(TestLM)

anova(TestLM)
# (F-statistic = 13.602, df = 19, 40), p-value < .001)
# The effect of age is significant
```

To have a better understanding of the different causes, we will now look at the three main causes of death among children and young-adults, to see, later, if there is a difference compared to adults.

# Causes of deaths among infants (0-19 years-old)

Here is a graph that present the type of death that we can find among children between 0 and 19 years-old. This graph confirm our prediction that children die mostly from communicable and non-communicable diseases.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
DeathInfant <-Deathstat[4:18,]

ggplot(DeathInfant, aes(x=Cause, y=Nb, fill=Category, width = 0.5)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Causes of death") + 
  ylab("Number of death per 100'000 people (0-19)") +
  facet_wrap(~ Category) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(color="Black", 
                           size=7, angle=90)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Lightpink", "Orange", "Lightblue"))

```

However, we saw earlier that there are more deaths among the 0-1 years-old compared to the 1-19 years-old. What happen if we compared causes of deaths among children between 1 and 19 years-old ?

## Causes of deaths between ages in children

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
DeathChild <- Deathstat[7:18,]

ggplot(DeathChild, aes(x=fct_relevel(Age, c("5-9"), after = 1), y=Nb, fill=Category, width=c(0.2))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Age groups") + 
  ylab("Number of death per 100'000 people (1-19)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Orange", "Lightblue"))

```

What we see in this graph confirms our hypothesis that children from 0 to 14 die mosly from communicable and non-communicable disease, and that young adults mostly die from injuries. Now that we confirmed our hypothesis with children and young-adults, lets take a look at the causes of deaths among adults to see if there is a difference between adults and children.

# Causes of deaths among adults

To have a better view, let's take only adults between 20 and 69, given the fact that there are more deaths after 75 year-old and what we see in the begining, in is only non-communicable diseases :

```{r}
DeathAdult2 <- Deathstat[19:48,]

ggplot(DeathAdult2, aes(x=Age, y=Nb, fill=Category, width=c(0.1))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Age groups (20-69)") + 
  ylab("Number of death per 100'000 people") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Orange", "Lightblue"))
```

What we can see is that :

# Conclusion

Children between 0-14 died mosly of communicable disease. Children and Adults between 15 - 49 die mosly of injuries. Then, people betweem 0-1 and between 40 and 85+ die mostly from non-communicable disease.
